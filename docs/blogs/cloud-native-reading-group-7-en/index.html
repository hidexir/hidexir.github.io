<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of you are not familiar with the term &ldquo;runc&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with docker as an engineer for a while now, and there are many cases where I touch it unconsciously.</p>
<p>A simple history of docker can be found here.</p>
<p><a href="https://eng-blog.iij.ad.jp/archives/1478">https://eng-blog.iij.ad.jp/archives/1478</a></p>
<p>Originally, docker had the same name for its engine and runtime.</p>
<p>Originally, docker had the same name for the engine and runtime, but there was a movement to separate the interface from the runtime inside. The reason for this is that it was originally separated as a module, and the background is to increase versatility.</p>
<p>Kubernetes and other container orchestrations also want to handle runc internally, so it is not surprising that they are starting to provide it as an API.</p>
<p>And runc is called low level runtime, which is the lowest layer.</p>
<p>These are very interesting.</p>
<p>There is a Japanese container runtime, Hakoniwa <a href="https://github.com/haconiwa/haconiwa">https://github.com/haconiwa/haconiwa</a>.
The above is probably not OCI compliant. The above is probably not OCI compliant, so it may not be usable for Kuber&rsquo;s runtime.</p>
<p>There is also gVisor, a secure container made by Google.</p>
<p>This is a document presented by a friend of mine, and it is very easy to understand.</p>

<p>It was very useful for me because I wanted to know about runc as the most important project! Thank you very much.</p>

<p>I would like to get my own room at night time and have more conversations.</p>
