# Info

# Basic
1995 Kanagawa, Japan

## Back born
I think the first time I became an engineer was when I saw Bloody Monday in elementary school.

My grandmother gave me a book on hacking, which cost about 8,000 yen at the time, and that was the starting point of my career. 

I still like to understand how things work, and I think it is important to understand and implement things correctly and honestly in my work.

My favorite areas of technology are security, performance tuning, networking, and Linux Kernel.

I also think that algorithms are very important, but I am still learning them.

There are a lot of patterns for personality assessment, so please try it. I thought a lot about the algorithm and the data structure behind the algorithm to classify the answers to the questions from the users as fast as possible.
I mainly used a tree structure and succeeded in speeding it up.
