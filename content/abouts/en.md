# Info
Thank you for reading.
I was born and raised in Tsujido, Kanagawa Prefecture in 1995.

I was influenced by Bloody Monday when I was in elementary school, and my aunt gave me a book that cost about 8,000 yen.
I would like to accelerate my business by pursuing technology through service creation, large-scale infrastructure, and security as a hobby.

# Project
## Video Streaming Service
Technology Stack
Go React(Typescirpt) AWS
In order to process the video to be delivered into HLS, we used lambda to convert mp4 to m3u8, and used video.js to realize streaming.
We implemented this from the video delivery server, so we were very resource conscious in our implementation.

## ad-technology header bidding
Based on the OSS [prebid-server](https://prebid.org/product-suite/prebid-server/), we created a bidder infrastructure and implemented it by extending the OSS. Header bidding is a mainstream auction system in the U.S. and other countries, and further auctions are conducted for each SSP, which improves matching between suppliers and users.

## [Service using Ethereum token](https://www.peace-coin.org/#! /message)
I worked mainly on the server side using the Solidity framework.

## [Personality assessment service](https://www.zelfium.com/ja/)
Technology Stack
Typescript Nuxt Express
There are a lot of patterns for personality assessment, so please try it out. I put a lot of thought into the algorithm and the data structure behind the algorithm to classify the answers to the questions from the user as fast as possible.
I mainly used a tree structure and succeeded in speeding it up.

## [Zombie game](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/escape-from-uncle/id1444505240)
Created by me and my classmate from CyberAgent days. I was very happy to see that there were even people doing [commentary](https://gameappch.com/app/?app=06132).
Technology Stack
Unity Maya
I mainly purchased the 3D objects and implemented the logic inside, map layout, and camera viewpoint control.
